  "description": "Container Attached Storage(CAS) is software that includes microservice based storage controllers that are orchestrated by Kubernetes. These storage controllers can run anywhere that Kubernetes can run which means any cloud or even bare metal server or on top of a traditional shared storage system. Critically, the data itself is also accessed via containers as opposed to being stored in an off platform shared scale out storage system. Because CAS leverages a microservices architecture, it keeps the storage solution closely tied to the application bound to the physical storage device, reducing I/O latency.",
